The Nobel Prize is a set of annual international awards bestowed in several categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, or scientific advances. The will of the Swedish chemist, engineer, and industrialist Alfred Nobel established the five Nobel prizes in 1895. The prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901.

The Nobel Prize in Physics is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the field of physics for outstanding contributions to humanity. The first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen in 1901 for his discovery of X-rays.

Albert Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from a material when light shines on it. This discovery was crucial for the development of quantum mechanics.
