# Implementing SOTA AI Papers

This repo is a collection of small implementations of some of the best and my favourite research publications in the space of AI in recent years.
All implementations are in Python.
Each folder corresponds to one paper and aims to capture the core algorithmic ideas with practical, minimal code (I have skipped experimentations, comparisons which is usually a big part of some of the papers, only focusing on the core methodology)

## Structure

- Each folder includes its own `README.md` with paper-specific notes, differences, and how to run
- Scripts are kept simple and something you can implement and play around with too.

## What to expect

- Algorithmic flow faithful to the original paperwhere possible
- You can expect explicit caveats when a paper uses finetuning (I might have used off the shelf LLM API, but I have mentioned all caveats/exceptions I made to the original paper in the READMEs)
