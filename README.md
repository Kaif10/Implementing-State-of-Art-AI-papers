# Implementing SOTA AI Papers

This repo is a collection of small implementations of some of the best AI research publications in recent years in Python.
Each folder corresponds to one paper and aims to capture the core algorithmic ideas with practical, minimal code.

## Structure

- One directory per paper 
- Each folder includes its own `README.md` with paper-specific notes, differences, and how to run
- Scripts are kept simple and sopmething you can implement and play around with too.

## What to expect

- Faithful algorithmic flow where possible
- Explicit caveats when a paper uses finetuning, logprobs, or special tooling
- Minimal dependencies and clear entry points
