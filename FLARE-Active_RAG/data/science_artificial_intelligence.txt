Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, perception, and language understanding.

Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, using neural networks with multiple layers, has driven many recent AI breakthroughs.

Large language models like GPT-4, Claude, and others have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform tasks ranging from translation to code generation.

AI applications are widespread, including autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. However, AI systems also raise concerns about bias, privacy, job displacement, and the need for regulation.

The field of AI safety focuses on ensuring AI systems are aligned with human values and operate reliably. Research areas include interpretability, robustness, and preventing harmful behaviors.
