The Renaissance was a period of cultural, artistic, and intellectual rebirth in Europe, spanning roughly from the 14th to the 17th century. It marked the transition from the Middle Ages to the modern era.

The Renaissance began in Italy, particularly in cities like Florence, Venice, and Rome. Key figures included Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Donatello in the arts, and thinkers like Machiavelli and Galileo in philosophy and science.

The period saw renewed interest in classical Greek and Roman texts, leading to humanism - a focus on human potential and achievements. The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg around 1440 helped spread Renaissance ideas throughout Europe.

Artistic achievements included realistic perspective in painting, anatomical accuracy in sculpture, and architectural innovations. Scientific advances included Copernicus's heliocentric model of the solar system and advances in anatomy and astronomy.

The Renaissance had profound effects on European society, politics, and culture, laying the groundwork for the Scientific Revolution and the Age of Enlightenment.
